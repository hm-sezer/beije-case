# AI Usage Log

## October 2, 2025 - Project Setup

### Initial Structure

**What I did manually:**
```bash
mkdir -p frontend backend shared docs
```

Created monorepo folder structure with:
- `frontend/` - for Next.js app
- `backend/` - for NestJS API  
- `shared/` - for shared types
- `docs/` - for documentation

### Configuration Files

**What I asked AI to do:**

1. **package.json** - Create root package.json with:
   - npm workspaces configuration for monorepo (frontend, backend, shared)
   - Scripts using `concurrently` to run both servers simultaneously
   - Workspace-level commands (dev, build, test, lint)
   - Node.js 18+ requirement

2. **.gitignore** - Create comprehensive gitignore with:
   - node_modules and all package manager files
   - Build outputs (.next, dist, build)
   - Environment files (.env variants)
   - Log files (npm, yarn, pnpm)
   - Database files (*.sqlite, *.db)
   - Editor configs (.vscode, .idea, .DS_Store)
   - Coverage and cache directories

**Result:** Got clean configuration files for monorepo setup with concurrent dev server execution.

### README Creation

**What I asked AI to do:**

Create a `README.md` file with the following structure:
- Project title and description
- Monorepo structure explanation (frontend, backend, shared, docs folders)
- Quick start guide with prerequisites (Node.js 18+, npm, Git)
- Installation steps (clone, install, dev commands)
- Features section listing:
  - Frontend: Custom package selection, responsive design, state management
  - Backend: Email verification, REST API, database integration
- Development scripts (dev, build, test, lint)
- API documentation with 3 endpoints:
  - POST /user/register
  - GET /user/verify-email/:username/:token
  - GET /user/check-verification/:username
- Testing strategy mention (unit, integration, E2E)
- AI assistance disclosure section
- Deployment, contributing, and license sections

**Result:** Got a comprehensive README that explains the full project scope and setup.

## Frontend Development - October 2, 2025

### Next.js and Dependencies Setup

**What I did manually:**

1. **Next.js Initialization**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npx create-next-app@latest .
   ```
   - Setup Next.js 15 with TypeScript
   - Configured App Router
   - Enabled ESLint

2. **shadcn Setup** (using latest CLI):
   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest init
   ```
   - Selected neutral color theme
   - Configured for Next.js App Router
   - CSS variables enabled

3. **shadcn Components**:
   ```bash
   npx shadcn@latest add button card accordion badge separator
   ```

4. **State Management and Utils**:
   ```bash
   npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux axios
   ```

**Why:** Needed component library and state management infrastructure before building the custom package selection page replica.

**Result:** Clean Next.js 15 setup with shadcn components and Redux ready for development.
